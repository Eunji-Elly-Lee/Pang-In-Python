### Description

This Python program implements the classic arcade game "Pang". In Pang, you control a character who must eliminate all the balls bouncing around the screen using a weapon.

- The player can move left and right using the arrow keys and launch weapons using the space key.
- At the start of the game, a large ball moves across the screen, splitting into smaller balls when hit by a weapon.
- The game ends if time runs out or your character is hit by a ball.

<br />

This Pang game is implemented using Pygame and can be run in Visual Studio Code.

### Features

- **Simple game play**: Easy control with arrow keys and space key
- **Error handling**: Ignoring input when other keys are pressed
- **Diverse ball conditions**: Four ball sizes with different movement radii
- **Increased Challenge**: Smallest balls require precise aim and are harder to hit
- **Time limit**: Eliminate all balls before the 100-second timer runs out
- **Automatic Termination**: Program automatically ends upon mission completion or game loss

### Running the Game in VS Code

1. Open `pang.py`
2. Click the "Run Python File" icon (triangle) to start the game
