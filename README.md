This is a program that implements the classic arcade game Pang using Python.

- A user can only move from side to side and uses the weapons to hit and eliminate all balls in the screen.
- The left and right keys are used to move the user's character, and the space key is used to launch weapons.
- When the game starts, a large ball moves in the screen, and the ball is divided into two small balls when a weapon hits the ball.
- The ball has a total of four sizes, and when the smallest ball hits the weapon, it disappears.
- If not to eliminate all balls within the 100 seconds, or if the character is hit by the ball, the game is over.
